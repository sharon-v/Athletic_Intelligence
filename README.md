## Description

We created an AI sport app, the user preforms a sport exercise (only squat available at the moment) and the app will
give him a score based on his performance. The app will also give the user real-time feedback on what mistakes are made
so that the user can improve his technique.

## Getting started

To activate the app, you need to follow the next steps:

1. Clone the project to your computer


2. Set up the backend:
```
    a. Open the Backend folder in PyCharm
    b. Make sure you have a compatible python version (3.10.4)
    c. (Optional) Create a virtual environment
    d. Install the requirements.txt file
    e. Run the flaskConnection.py file
    f. Copy the server address
```

3. Set up the frontend:
```
    a. Open the Frontend folder in Anroid Studio
    
    b. To run the app using an emulator:
        1. Open the Device Manager to create a virtual device
        2. Choose Pixel 4 with API 30
        3. Go to advanced settings
        4. Make sure the front camera is enabled 
        5. Finish setting up the emulator
        
    c. To run the app using your phone:
        1. Make sure your computer and phone are on the same network
        2. Open the Device Manager and choose "physical device"
        3. Connect your phone to your computer using cable or wifi
        4. Go to developer settings on your phone and enable USB/wifi debugging
        
    d. Go to "SquatActivity.java" file 
    e. Change the attribute "url" address to the one you copied in step 2.f
```
4. Run the app
