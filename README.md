## Description

We created an AI sport app, the user preforms a sport exercise (only squat available at the moment) and the app will
give him a score based on his performance. The app will also give the user real-time feedback on what mistakes are made
so that the user can improve his technique.

    d. Install the requirements.txt file
    e. Run the flaskConnection.py file
    f. Copy the server address

        4. Make sure the front camera is enabled 
        5. Finish setting up the emulator
